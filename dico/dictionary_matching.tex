\begin{abstract}
The aim of this chapter is to provide a fast and efficient procedure
for (real-time) target identification in imaging based on matching
on a dictionary of precomputed generalized polarization tensors.
The approach is based on some important properties of the
GPTs and new invariants. A new shape representation is given and
numerically tested in the presence of measurement noise. The
stability and resolution of the proposed identification algorithm
is numerically quantified.

\section{Introduction}

An important use of the concept of GPT is for imaging diametrically
small inclusions from boundary measurements. Based on the multipolar expansion
computed in section~\ref{sub:asymptotic-expansion-perturbed-potential-field},
efficient algorithms to
determine the location and some geometric features of the
inclusions have been proposed in previous works (see \cite{ammari2004reconstruction,
ammari2007polarization} and the references therein for recent
developments of this theory).

In \cite{ammari2010conductivity}, a recursive optimal control scheme to recover
fine shape details of a given domain using GPTs is proposed. In
\cite{AGKLY11}, it is shown that high-frequency oscillations of
the boundary of a domain are only contained in its high-order
GPTs. Moreover, by developing a level set version of the recursive
optimization scheme, it is also shown that the GPTs can capture
the topology of the domain. An efficient algorithm for computing
the GPTs has been presented in \cite{yves}.


The aim of this chapter is to show that the GPTs can be used for
shape identification from imaging data. Based on the results of
chapter~\ref{chap:GPT-extraction}, we design a fast algorithm which
identifies a target using a dictionary of precomputed GPTs data.
Suppose that we have a
dictionary which is a collection of standard shapes (for example
alphabetic letters or flowers). Our aim is to identify from
imaging data a shape which is obtained from one element of the
dictionary after some rotation, scaling and translation. We design
a dictionary matching procedure which operates directly in the
GPTs data. Our procedure is based on some important properties of
the GPTs and new invariants. We test the robustness of our
procedure with respect to a measurement noise in the imaging data.
Our approach is quite natural since it uses geometric quantities
obtained from the imaging data by simply inverting a linear
system. Moreover, there is an infinite number of invariants
associated with the GPTs. Furthermore, for a given dictionary, the
GPT-based representation may lead to better distinguishibility
between the dictionary elements.


Over the last decades, a considerable amount of work has been
devoted to nonlinear optimization techniques for solving the
imaging problem; see, for instance, \cite{opt,opt1,opt2} and the
references therein. More recently, new regularized optimal control
formulations for target imaging have been proposed in
\cite{optnew1,optnew2}. As far as we know, our approach in this
chapter provides for the first time an alternative approach to
solving the full inverse problem for target identification and
characterization. It opens a way for real-time target
identification and tracking algorithms in wave imaging.

The chapter is organized as follows. In section
\ref{sec:complex-cgpt-under} it is shown that the CGPTs have some
nice properties, such as simple rotation and translation formulas and
simple relation with shape symmetry. In section \ref{sec:shape-ident-cgpt}
we derive two algorithms for shape identification based on those relations.
Section \ref{sec:numer-exper} presents
a variety of numerical results for the target identification
problem and shows the viability of the proposed procedure.

\section{Complex CGPTs under Rigid Motions and Scaling}\label{sec:complex-cgpt-under}
As we will see later, a complex combination of CGPTs is most
convenient when we consider the transforms of CGPTs under
dilatation and rigid motions, \emph{i.e.}, shift and rotation.
Therefore, for a double index $mn$, with $m,n=1,2,\ldots$, we
introduce the following complex combination of CGPTs:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(\lambda, D) &= (M^{cc}_{mn} - M^{ss}_{mn}) +
i(M^{cs}_{mn} + M^{sc}_{mn}),\\
N_{mn}^{(2)}(\lambda, D) &= (M^{cc}_{mn} + M^{ss}_{mn}) +
i(M^{cs}_{mn} - M^{sc}_{mn}).
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Mccdef}
\end{equation}
% Let $P_m(x)$ be the complex valued polynomial
% \begin{equation*}
% P_m(x) = (x_1 + i x_2)^m.
% \end{equation*}
Then, from (\ref{eq:Mdef}),  we observe that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(\lambda, D) &= \int_{\partial D} P_n(y)  (\lambda
I - \K^*_{D})^{-1}[\langle \nu, \nabla P_m \rangle](y)\,
ds(y),\\
N_{mn}^{(2)}(\lambda, D) &= \int_{\partial D} P_n(y)  (\lambda
I - \K^*_{D})^{-1}[\langle \nu, \nabla \overline{P_m} \rangle] (y) \, ds(y),\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $P_n$ and $P_m$ are defined by (\ref{eq:Pdef}). In order to
simplify the notation, we drop $\lambda$ in the following and
write simply $N_{mn}^{(1)}(D), N_{mn}^{(2)}(D)$.

We consider the translation, the rotation and the dilatation of
the domain $D$ by
 introducing the following notation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Shift: $T_zD = \{x+z, \mbox{ for } x\in D\}$, for $z \in
\R^2$; \item Rotation: $R_\theta D = \{e^{i\theta}x, \mbox{ for }
x\in D\}$, for $\theta\in[0,2\pi)$; \item Scaling: $sD=\{sx,
\mbox{ for } x\in D\}$, for $s>0$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:complex-cgpt-under}
  For all integers $m,n$, and geometric parameters $\theta$, $s$, and $z$, the following
  holds:
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    &N_{mn}^{(1)}(R_\theta D)  = e^{i(m+n)\theta}N_{mn}^{(1)}(D), \quad
    &&N_{mn}^{(2)}(R_\theta D) = e^{i(n-m)\theta}N_{mn}^{(2)}(D),    \label{eq:CGPT_rot_Nt}\\
    \nm
    &N_{mn}^{(1)}(sD)  = {s^{m+n}}N_{mn}^{(1)}(D),   \quad
    &&N_{mn}^{(2)}(sD) = {s^{m+n}}N_{mn}^{(2)}(D),    \label{eq:CGPT_scl_Nt}\\
    \nm
    &N_{mn}^{(1)}(T_zD)  = \sum_{l=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbf{C}^z_{ml}\No_{lk}(D) \mathbf{C}^z_{nk},
    \quad
    &&N_{mn}^{(2)}(T_zD) = \sum_{l=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^n \overline{\mathbf{C}^z_{ml}}N_{lk}^{(2)}(D) \mathbf{C}^z_{nk},    \label{eq:CGPT_trans_Nt}
  \end{alignat}
  where $\mathbf{C}^z$ is a lower triangle matrix with the $m,n$-th entry given
  by
  \begin{equation} \label{defcz}
  \mathbf{C}^z_{mn}= \binom{m}{n}  z^{m-n},
  \end{equation}
  and $\overline{\mathbf{C}^z}$ denotes its conjugate. Here, we
  identify $z=(z_1,z_2)$ with $z= z_1 + i z_2$.
\end{proposition}

An ingredient that we will need in the proof is the following
chain rule between the gradient of a function and its push forward
under transformation.  In fact, for any diffeomorphism $T$ from
$\R^2$ to $\R^2$ and any scalar-valued differentiable map $f$ on
$\R^2$, we have
\begin{equation}
\textrm{d} (f\circ T) \big|_x (h) = \left(\textrm{d} f
\big|_{T(x)} \circ \textrm{d}T\big|_x \right) (h),
\label{eq:chainrule}
\end{equation}
for any tangent vector $h \in \R^2$, with $\textrm{d}T$ being the
differential of $T$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:complex-cgpt-under}] We will follow proofs of similar relations that can be found in \cite{AGKLY11}.
Let us first show (\ref{eq:CGPT_rot_Nt}) for the rotated domain
$D_\theta:=R_\theta D$. For a function $\varphi(y), y\in
\partial D$, we define a function $\varphi^\theta(y_\theta)$,
$y_\theta := R_\theta y \in \partial D_\theta$ by
\begin{equation*}
\varphi^\theta(y_\theta) = \varphi \circ R_{-\theta} (y_\theta) =
\varphi(y).
\end{equation*}
It is proved in \cite{AGKLY11} that $\lambda I - \K^*_D$ is
invariant under the rotation map, that is,
\begin{equation}
(\lambda I - \K^*_{D_\theta})[\varphi^\theta] (y_\theta) =
(\lambda I - \K^*_{D})[\varphi](y). \label{eq:ImKrot}
\end{equation}
We also check that $P_m(R_\theta y) = e^{im\theta} P_m(y)$.

We will focus on the relation for $N_{mn}^{(1)}$, the other one can be
proved in the same way. By definition, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) &= \int_{\partial D} P_n(y) \varphi_{D,m}(y) ds(y),\\
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D_\theta) &= \int_{\partial D_\theta} P_n(y_\theta) \varphi_{D_\theta,m}(y_\theta) ds(y_\theta),\\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Nnm-Nnm_theta}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\varphi_{D,m}(y) &= (\lambda I - \K^*_{D})^{-1} [\langle \nu, \nabla P_m \rangle](y), \\
\varphi_{D_\theta,m}(y_\theta) &= (\lambda I -
\K^*_{D_\theta})^{-1}[\langle \nu, \nabla P_m \rangle ](y_\theta).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Note that the last function differs from $\varphi^{\theta}_{D,m}$.
By the change of variables $y_\theta=R_{\theta} y$ in the first
expression of  (\ref{eq:Nnm-Nnm_theta}), we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) &= \int_{\partial D_\theta} P_n(R_{-\theta}y_\theta)
\varphi_{D,m}(R_{-\theta}y_\theta)
ds(y_\theta)\\
&= e^{-i n\theta}\int_{\partial D_\theta} P_n(y_\theta) \varphi^{\theta}_{D,m}(y_\theta) ds(y_\theta).\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
From (\ref{eq:ImKrot}), we have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
(\lambda I - \K^*_{D_\theta})[\varphi^\theta_{D,m}](y_\theta) &= (\lambda I - \K^*_{D})[\varphi_{D,m}](y)\\
&= \langle \nu_y, \nabla P_m(y) \rangle.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Moreover, $P_m(y)=e^{-im\theta}P_m(y_\theta)$ so that, by applying
the chain rule (\ref{eq:chainrule}) with $f=P_m$, $T=R_\theta$,
$x=y$ and $h=\nu_y$, we can conclude that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\langle \nu_y,\nabla P_m(y) \rangle &= e^{-im\theta}\langle R_\theta\nu_y, \nabla P_m(y_\theta) \rangle \\
&= e^{-im\theta}\langle \nu_{y_\theta}, \nabla P_m(y_\theta)
\rangle.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Therefore,
$\varphi^\theta_{D,m}=e^{-im\theta}\varphi_{D_\theta,m}$, and we
conclude that
$N_{mn}^{(1)}(D_\theta)=e^{i(m+n)\theta}N_{mn}^{(1)}(D)$.

The second identity in (\ref{eq:CGPT_rot_Nt}) results from the
same computation as above (the minus sign comes form the conjugate
in the definition of $\Nt$), and the two equations in
(\ref{eq:CGPT_scl_Nt}) are proved in the same way, replacing the
transformed function $\varphi^\theta$ by
\begin{equation*}
\varphi^s(sy)=\varphi(y).
\end{equation*}

Thus, only (\ref{eq:CGPT_trans_Nt}) remains. Since the difference
between these two comes from the conjugation, we will focus only
on the first identity in (\ref{eq:CGPT_trans_Nt}). The strategy
will be once again the following: for a function $\varphi(y), y
\in
\partial D$, we define a function $\varphi^z(y_z), y_z =y + z \in
\partial D_z$, with $D_z:=T_z D$,  by
\begin{equation*}
\varphi^z(y_z)=\varphi \circ T_{-z}(y_z)=\varphi(y),
\end{equation*}
which also verifies an invariance relation similar to
(\ref{eq:ImKrot})
\begin{equation}
(\lambda I - \K^*_{D_z})[\varphi^z](y_z) = (\lambda I - \K^*_{D})
[\varphi] (y). \label{eq:ImKtrans}
\end{equation}
Moreover, for every integer $q\in\mathbb{N}$ one has the following
\begin{equation}
P_q(y_z) = (y+z)^q = \sum_{r=0}^q  \binom {q} {r} y^r z^{q-r}.
\label{eq:develop_P_q}
\end{equation}
Equations (\ref{eq:Nnm-Nnm_theta}) become
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) &= \int_{\partial D} P_n(y) \varphi_{D,m}(y) ds(y),\\
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D_z) &= \int_{\partial D_z} P_n(y_z) \varphi_{D_z,m}(y_z) ds(y_z),\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\varphi_{D,m}(y) &= (\lambda I - \K^*_{D})^{-1}[\langle \nu, \nabla P_m\rangle](y), \\
\varphi_{D_z,m}(y_z) &= (\lambda I - \K^*_{D_z})^{-1}[\langle \nu,
\nabla P_m \rangle](y_z).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Thus, combining (\ref{eq:ImKtrans}) and (\ref{eq:develop_P_q})
leads us to
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
(\lambda I - \K^*_{D_z})[\varphi_{D_z,m}](y_z) & = \langle \nu_{y_z}, \nabla P_m(y_z) \rangle \\
 &= \langle \nu_{y},\sum_{l=1}^m  \binom {m} {l} z^{m-l}\nabla P_l(y)  \rangle \\
 &= \sum_{l=1}^m  \binom {m} {l} z^{m-l} (\lambda I-\K^{*}_D)[\varphi_{D,l}] (y) \\
 &= \sum_{l=1}^m  \binom {m} {l} z^{m-l} (\lambda I-\K^{*}_{D_z})[\varphi^z_{D,l}] (y_z), \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
so that we have
\begin{equation*}
\varphi_{D_z,m} (y)= \sum_{l=1}^m  \binom {m} {l} z^{m-l}
\varphi^z_{D,l}(y_z).
\end{equation*}
Hence, returning to the definition of $N_{mn}^{(1)}(D_z)$ with the
substitution $y_z\leftrightarrow y$, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
N_{mn}^{(1)}(D_z) &= \sum_{l=1}^m \binom{m}{l} z^{m-l }\int_{\partial D_z}P_n(y_z) \varphi^z_{D,l}(y_z) ds(y_z), \\
 &= \sum_{l=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{m}{l}\binom{n}{k}z^{m-l}z^{n-k}\No_{lk}(D),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
which is the desired result. Note that the index $k$ begins with
$k=1$ because $\int_{\partial D_z}\varphi^z_{D,l} = 0$. This
completes the proof. \end{proof}

\subsection{Some properties of complex CGPTs}\label{sec:some-properties-ccgpt}

We define the complex  CGPT matrices by $\No:= (N_{mn}^{(1)})_{m,n}$
and $\Nt:= (N_{mn}^{(2)})_{m,n}$. We set $w=se^{i\theta}$ and
introduce the diagonal matrix $\mathbf{G}^w$ with the $m$-th
diagonal entry given by $s^me^{im\theta}$. Proposition
\ref{prop:complex-cgpt-under} implies immediately that
\begin{align}
  \No(\tsr D) &= \mathbf{C}^z \mathbf{G}^w\No(D) \mathbf{G}^w(\mathbf{C}^z)^T ,\label{eq:DB_tsr_No}\\
  \nm
  \Nt(\tsr D) &= \overline{\mathbf{C}^z \mathbf{G}^w}\Nt(D) \mathbf{G}^w(\mathbf{C}^z)^T, \label{eq:DB_tsr_Nt}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{C}^z$ is defined by (\ref{defcz}). Relations
(\ref{eq:DB_tsr_No}) and (\ref{eq:DB_tsr_Nt}) still hold for the
truncated CGPTs of finite order, due to the triangular shape of
the matrix $\mathbf{C}^z$.
% involved in \eqref{eq:DB_tsr_No} and \eqref{eq:DB_tsr_Nt} are
% truncated, \ie, $\No(B)$ and $\Nt(B)$ have finite dimension.
Using the symmetry  of the CGPTs (\cite[Theorem
4.11]{ammari2007polarization}) and the positivity of the GPTs as
proved in \cite{ammari2007polarization}, we  easily establish
the following result.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:CGPT_symm_herm}
  The complex CGPT matrix $\No$ is symmetric: $(\No)^T = \No$, and $\Nt$ is
  Hermitian: $(\Nt)^H = \Nt$. Consequently, the diagonal elements of
  $\Nt$ are strictly positive if $\lambda >0$ and strictly negative if $\lambda <0$.
\end{proposition}

Furthermore, the CGPTs of rotation invariant shapes have special
structures:
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:CGPT_rotsymm_struct}
  Suppose that $D$ is invariant under rotation of angle $2\pi/p$ for
  some integer $p\geq 2$, \emph{i.e.}, $R_{2\pi/p}D = D$, then
  \begin{align}
    N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) = 0 \mbox{ if } p \mbox{ does not divide }  (m+n) \label{eq:CGPT_struct_No},\\
    \nm
    N_{mn}^{(2)}(D) = 0 \mbox{ if } p \mbox{ does not divide } (m-n).
    \label{eq:CGPT_struct_Nt}
  \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $p$ does not divide $(m+n)$, and define $r:=2\pi(n+m)/p \mbox{ mod }
  2\pi$. Then by the rotation symmetry of $D$ and the symmetry property
  of the
  CGPTs, we have
  $$
  N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) = N_{mn}^{(1)}(R_{2\pi /p}D) = e^{i(m+n)2\pi/p}N_{mn}^{(1)}(D) =
  e^{ir}N_{mn}^{(1)}(D).
  $$
  Since $r<2\pi$ and $r\neq 0$, we conclude that $N_{mn}^{(1)}(D)=0$. The
  proof of \eqref{eq:CGPT_struct_Nt} is similar.
\end{proof}



\section{Shape Identification by the CGPTs}\label{sec:shape-ident-cgpt}

We call a \emph{dictionary} $\dico$  a collection of standard
shapes, which are centered at the origin and with characteristic
sizes of order 1. Given the CGPTs of an unknown shape $D$, and
assuming that $D$ is obtained from a certain element $B\in\dico$
by applying some unknown rotation $\theta$, scaling $s$ and
translation $z$, \ie, $D=T_zsR_\theta B$, our objective is to
recognize $B$ from $\dico$. For doing so, one may proceed by first
reconstructing the shape $D$ using its CGPTs through some
optimization procedures as proposed in \cite{ammari2010conductivity}, and then
match the reconstructed shape with $\dico$. However, such a method
may be time-consuming and the recognition efficiency depends on
the shape reconstruction algorithm.

We propose in subsections \ref{sec:cgpt-matching} and
\ref{sec:transf-invar-shape} two shape identification algorithms
using the CGPTs. The first one matches the CGPTs of data with that
of the dictionary element by estimating the transform parameters,
while the second one is based on a transform invariant shape
descriptor obtained from the CGPTs. The second approach is
computationally more efficient. Both of them operate directly in
the data domain which consists of CGPTs and avoid the need for
reconstructing the shape $D$. The heart of our approach is some
basic algebraic equations between the CGPTs of $D$ and $B$ that
can be deduced easily from \eqref{eq:DB_tsr_No} and
\eqref{eq:DB_tsr_Nt}. Particularly, the first four equations read:
\begin{align}
  N_{11}^{(1)}(D) &= w^2 N_{11}^{(1)}(B), \label{eq:No11}\\
  N_{12}^{(1)}(D) &= 2N_{11}^{(1)}(D)z + w^3 N_{12}^{(1)}(B), \label{eq:No12}\\
  N_{11}^{(2)}(D) &= s^2 N_{11}^{(2)}(B),\label{eq:Nt11}\\
  N_{12}^{(2)}(D) &= 2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)z + s^2wN_{12}^{(2)}(B),\label{eq:Nt12}
\end{align}
where $w=s e^{i \theta}$.

\subsection{CGPTs matching}
\label{sec:cgpt-matching}
% The basic idea here is to compare the CGPT of data with that of each
% dictionary element, in order to retreive the transform parameters
% then calculate the similarity between the CGPTs. Intuitively, the true
% dictionary element will give the correct transform parameters hence
% the most similar CGPT.

\subsubsection{Determination of transform
  parameters}\label{sec:determ-transf-param}
Suppose that the complex CGPT matrices $\No(B), \Nt(B)$ of the
true shape $B$ are given. Then, from \eqref{eq:Nt11}, we obtain
that
\begin{align}
  s = \sqrt{N_{11}^{(2)}(D) / N_{11}^{(2)}(B)}. \label{eq:scaling}
\end{align}
% The translation and the rotation parameters can also be determined
% under specific conditions.

\paragraph{Case 1: Rotational symmetric shape.}
If the shape $B$ has rotational symmetry, \ie, $R_{2\pi /p}B =B$
for some $p\geq 2$, then from Proposition
\ref{prop:CGPT_rotsymm_struct} we have $N_{12}^{(2)}(B)=0$ and the
translation parameter $z$ is uniquely determined from
\eqref{eq:Nt12} by
\begin{align}
  z = \frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(D)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)}. \label{eq:trans_P2}
\end{align}
On the contrary, the rotation parameter $\theta$ (or $\yr$) can
only be determined up to a multiple of ${2\pi/p}$, from CGPTs of
order $\lceil p/2 \rceil$ at least. Although explicit expressions
of $e^{ip\theta}$ can be deduced from
\eqref{eq:No11}~-~\eqref{eq:Nt12} (or higher order equations if
necessary), we propose to recover $e^{ip\theta}$ by solving the
least squares problem:
\begin{align}
  \min_\theta \left(\norm{\No(\tsr B) - \No(D)}_F^2 + \norm{\Nt(\tsr
      B) - \Nt(D)}_F^2\right).  \label{eq:rot_lst}
\end{align}
Here, $s$ and $z$ are given by (\ref{eq:scaling}) and
(\ref{eq:trans_P2}) respectively, and $\No(D)$ and $\Nt(D)$ are
the truncated complex CGPTs matrices of dimension $\lceil p/2
\rceil \times \lceil p/2 \rceil$.

% Using the Proposition \ref{prop:CGPT_rotsymm_struct} the following can
% be established:
% \begin{align}
%   \mbox{for } P=2: \ w^2\No_{1,1}(B) &= \No_{1,1}(D)\\
%   \mbox{for } P=3: \ w^3\No_{1,2}(B) &= \No_{1,2}(D) - 2\No_{1,1}(B)z\\
%   \mbox{for } P=4: \ w^4\No_{2,2}(B) &= \No_{2,2}(D)
% \end{align}

\paragraph{Case 2: Non rotational symmetric shape.}
Consider a non rotational symmetric shape $B$ which satisfies the
assumption:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:cond_P1}
 N_{11}^{(1)}(B) \neq 0 \quad \mbox{and} \quad  \mbox{det}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    N_{11}^{(1)}(B) & N_{11}^{(2)}(B) \\
    N_{12}^{(1)}(B) & N_{12}^{(2)}(B)
  \end{pmatrix} \neq 0.
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:No12} and \eqref{eq:Nt12}, it follows that we can
uniquely determine the translation $z$ and the rotation parameter
$w= e^{i\theta}$ from CGPTs of orders one and two by solving the
following linear system:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:linsys_P1}
  N_{12}^{(1)}(D)/N_{11}^{(1)}(D) &= 2z + w N_{12}^{(1)}(B)/N_{11}^{(1)}(B), \notag \\
  \nm
  N_{12}^{(2)}(D)/N_{11}^{(2)}(D) &= 2z + w N_{12}^{(2)}(B)/N_{11}^{(2)}(B).
\end{align}

% Remark that for $P=2$, $\No_{1,2}(B)=0, \Nt_{2,1}(B)=0$ so the
% determinant vanishes; while $\No_{1,1}(B)=0$ for $P\geq 3$ thus the
% linear system cannot be used as long as $P>1$.

\subsubsection{Debiasing by least squares solutions} \label{secdeb} In practice (for both the rotational symmetric and non rotational
symmetric cases), the value of the parameters $z, s$ and $\theta$
provided by the analytical formulas and numerical procedures above
may be inexact, due to the noise in the data and the
ill-conditioned character of the linear system
(\ref{eq:linsys_P1}). Let $z^*, s^*, \theta^*$ be the true
transform parameters, which can be considered as  perturbations
around the estimations $z, s, \theta$ obtained above:
\begin{align}
  z^*=z+\delta_z, \ s^*=s \delta_s, \mbox{ and } \theta^*=\theta+\delta_\theta , \label{eq:parameters_pertub}
\end{align}
for $\delta_z, \delta_\theta$ small and $\delta_s$ close to 1. To
find these perturbations, we solve a nonlinear least squares
problem:
\begin{align}
  \min_{z',s',\theta'}
  \left(\norm{\No(T_{z'}s'R_{\theta'} B) -
      \No(D)}_F^2 +
    \norm{\Nt(T_{z'}s'R_{\theta'} B) - \Nt(
      D)}_F^2\right) , \label{eq:tsr_lst_debiasing}
\end{align}
with $(z,s,\theta)$ as an initial guess. Here, the order of the
CGPTs in (\ref{eq:tsr_lst_debiasing}) is taken to be $2$ in the
non rotational case and $\max(2, [p/2])$ in the rotational
symmetric case. Thanks to the relations \eqref{eq:DB_tsr_No} and
\eqref{eq:DB_tsr_Nt}, one can calculate explicitly the derivatives
of the objective function, therefore can solve
\eqref{eq:tsr_lst_debiasing} by means of standard gradient-based
optimization methods.

\subsubsection{First algorithm for shape identification}\label{sec:first-algor-shape}
For each dictionary element, we determine the transform parameters
as above, then measure the similarity of the complex CGPT matrices
using the Frobenius norm, and choose the most similar element as
the identified shape. Intuitively, the true dictionary element
will give the correct transform parameters hence the most similar
CGPTs. This procedure is described in Algorithm
\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Shape identification based on CGPT matching}
  \label{algo:shape-ident-cgpt}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \STATE Input: the first $k$-th order CGPTs $\No(D), \Nt(D)$ of an unknown shape $D$
    \FOR {$B_n\in\dico$}
    \STATE 1. Estimation of $z, s, \theta$ using the procedures described in
    subsections~\ref{sec:determ-transf-param} and \ref{secdeb};
    \STATE 2. $\tilde D \leftarrow R_{-\theta}s^{-1}T_{-z}D$, and calculate $\No(\tilde D)$ and  $\Nt(\tilde
    D)$;
    \STATE 3. $E^{(1)}\leftarrow \No(B_n) - \No(\tilde D)$, and $E^{(2)}\leftarrow \Nt(B_n) - \Nt(\tilde
    D)$;
    \STATE 4.
    $e_n\leftarrow (\norm{E^{(1)}}_F^2 + \norm{E^{(2)}}_F^2)^{1/2}/
    (\norm{\No(B_n)}_F^2 + \norm{\Nt(B_n)}_F^2)^{1/2}$;
%    \STATE 4. $e_n\leftarrow e_n / (\norm{\No(B_n)}_F^2 + \norm{\Nt(B_n)}_F^2)^{1/2}$
    \STATE 5. $n\leftarrow n+1$;
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Output: the true dictionary element $n^*\leftarrow \mbox{argmin}_n
    e_n$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Transform invariant shape descriptors}
\label{sec:transf-invar-shape} From \eqref{eq:Nt11} and
\eqref{eq:Nt12} we deduce the following identity:
\begin{align}
  \frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(D)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)} = z +
  s\yr\frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(B)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(B)}, \label{eq:centroid}
\end{align}
which is well defined since $N_{11}^{(2)}\neq 0$ thanks to the
Proposition \ref{prop:CGPT_symm_herm}. Identity
\eqref{eq:centroid} shows a very simple relationship between
$\frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(B)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(B)}$ and
$\frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(D)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)}$ for $D= T_z s R_\theta B$. .

Let $u=\frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(D)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)}$. We first define  the
following quantities which are translation invariant:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:shape_descrp_trans}
  \Tauo(D) &= \No(T_{-u}D) = \mathbf{C}^{-u}\No(D)(\mathbf{C}^{-u})^T, \\
  \nm
  \Taut(D) &= \Nt(T_{-u}D) = \overline{\mathbf{C}^{-u}}\Nt(D)(\mathbf{C}^{-u})^T,
\end{align}
with the matrix $\mathbf{C}^{-u}$ being the same as in Proposition
\ref{prop:complex-cgpt-under}. From $\Tauo(D)
=(\Tauo_{mm}(D))_{m,n}$ and $\Taut(D) =(\Taut_{mm}(D))_{m,n}$, we
define, for any indices $m,n$, the scaling invariant quantities:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:shape_descrp_scl}
  \Sclo_{mn}(D) =
  \frac{\Tauo_{mn}(D)}{\left(\Taut_{mm}(D)\Taut_{nn}(D)\right)^{1/2}}, \
  \Sclt_{mn}(D) =
  \frac{\Taut_{mn}(D)}{\left(\Taut_{mm}(D)\Taut_{nn}(D)\right)^{1/2}}
  .
\end{align}
% \begin{align}
%   \label{eq:shape_descrp_scl}
%   \Sclo_{mn}(D) =
%   \frac{\Tauo_{mn}(D)}{(\Taut_{1,1}(D))^{\frac{m+n}{2}}}, \
%   \Sclt_{mn}(D) =
%   \frac{\Taut_{mn}(D)}{(\Taut_{1,1}(D))^{\frac{m+n}{2}}}
% \end{align}
Finally, we introduce the CGPT-based shape descriptors $\Dcrpo = (
\Dcrpo_{mn})_{m,n}$ and $\Dcrpt =  (\Dcrpt_{mn})_{m,n}$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:shape_descrp}
  \Dcrpo_{mn}(D) = |\Sclo_{mn}(D)|, \ \Dcrpt_{mn}(D) =
  |\Sclt_{mn}(D)|,
\end{align}
where $|\cdot|$ denotes the modulus of a complex number.
Constructed in this way, $\Dcrpo$ and $\Dcrpt$ are clearly
invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling.

It is worth emphasizing the symmetry property, $\Dcrpo_{mn} =
\Dcrpo_{nm}, \Dcrpt_{mn} = \Dcrpt_{nm}$, and the fact that
$\Dcrpt_{mm} =1$ for any $m$.

\subsubsection{Second algorithm for shape identification}\label{sec:second-algor-shape}
Thanks to the transform invariance of the new shape descriptors,
there is no need now for calculating the transform parameters, and
the similarity between a dictionary element and the unknown shape
can be directly measured from $\Dcrpo$ and $\Dcrpt$. As in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt}, we use the Frobenius norm
as the distance between two shape descriptors and compare with all
the elements of the dictionary. We propose a simplified method for
shape identification, as described in Algorithm
\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Shape identification based on transform invariant descriptors}
  \label{algo:shape-ident-inv}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \STATE Input: the first $k$-th order shape descriptors $\Dcrpo(D), \Dcrpt(D)$ of an unknown shape $D$
    \FOR {$B_n\in\dico$}
    % \STATE 1. $E^{(1)}\leftarrow \Dcrpo(B_n) - \Dcrpo(D)$, and $E^{(2)}\leftarrow \Dcrpt(B_n) - \Dcrpt(D)$
    % STATE 2.
    % $e_n\leftarrow (\norm{E^{(1)}}_F^2 + \norm{E^{(2)}}_F^2)^{1/2}/
    % (\norm{\Dcrpo(B_n)}_F^2 + \norm{\Dcrpt(B_n)}_F^2)^{1/2}$
    % \STATE 3. $n\leftarrow n+1$

    \STATE 1.
    $e_n\leftarrow \left(\norm{\Dcrpo(B_n) - \Dcrpo(D)}_F^2 + \norm{\Dcrpt(B_n) -
    \Dcrpt(D)}_F^2\right)^{1/2}$;
    \STATE 2. $n\leftarrow n+1$;
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Output: the true dictionary element $n^*\leftarrow \mbox{argmin}_n
    e_n$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\section{Numerical Experiments} \label{sec:numer-exper}

In this section, we will present the results of identification that were
theoretically shown in the previous sections. 

The identification process will be as follows (note that the first two are the
same as in section~\ref{sec:results-GPT-extraction}).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data simulation (see setting in Figure~\ref{fig:data_acq_dico})
\item Reconstruction of the CGPTs of $D=D_0-z_0$ using formula
  \eqref{eq:Mest} or the least squares algorithm \eqref{eq:lsqr-GPT-reconstruction}.
\item For a given dictionary $\dico$, apply
  Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} (or
  Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv}) using the CGPTs of $D$ and
  identify the true shape from $\dico$.
\end{enumerate}
As in chapter~\ref{chap:GPT-extraction}, the conductivity parameter
is fixed to $k=4/3$. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig1_ellipse_std}
  \caption{An example of the configuration for MSR data
    simulation. The unknown shape is an ellipse whose long and short
    axes are 2 and 1, respectively. $N=51$ sources/receivers (marked by
    ``x'') are equally placed on a circle of radius $R=2$ centered at
    $z_0=[0,0]$ (marked by ``*'').}
  \label{fig:data_acq_dico}
  % [58.2, 37.9]
\end{figure}



% \subsection{Dictionary matching}
Unless specified, in the following
we suppose that the unknown shape of the target $D_0$ is an exact
copy of some element from the dictionary, up to a rigid transform
and dilatation. As examples, we consider a dictionary of flowers
and a dictionary of Roman letters. The aim is to identify the
target $D_0$ from imaging data if it belongs to one of the
dictionaries.


\subsection{Matching on a dictionary of flowers}\label{sec:match-dico-flower}
We start by considering a simple dictionary of rotation invariant
``flowers'', on which the shape identification algorithm can be
greatly simplified. The boundary of the $p$-th flower $B_p$ is
defined as a small perturbation of the standard disk:
\begin{align}
  \partial B_p(\xi) = x(\xi)(1+\eta \cos(p\xi)), \mbox{ } x(\xi)=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\xi\\ \sin\xi
  \end{pmatrix} ,
  \label{eq:flower}
\end{align}
where $p\geq 2$ is the number of petals and $\eta>0$ is a small
constant. According to Proposition \ref{prop:CGPT_rotsymm_struct},
$N_{mn}^{(1)}(B_p)$ is zero if $p$ does not divide $m+n$.  For an
unknown shape $D=T_zsR_\theta B_p$, the translation parameter is
given by $z=\frac{N_{12}^{(2)}(D)}{2N_{11}^{(2)}(D)}$. Moreover, simple
calculations show that $\Dcrpo(D)$ and $\No(B_p)$ have exactly the
same zero patterns.


Therefore, we can find the true number of petals by searching the
first nonzero anti-diagonal entry in $\Dcrpo(D)$.

We fix $\eta=0.3$ (the amplitude of the perturbation introduced in
(\ref{eq:flower})) and $\delta/R=0.5$. The unknown shape $D_0$ is
obtained by applying the transform parameters $z=[16.3, -46.7],
s=7.5, \theta=2.69$ on $B_p$, and the reference point for data
acquisition is $z_0=[15, -45.5]$. The results for two flowers of 5
and 7 petals are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:matching_flower}, where
we plot the mean absolute value of the anti-diagonal entries $mn$,
for $m+n =l, l=2, \ldots, 11,$ in $\Dcrpo(D)$ by varying the noise
level $\sigma_0$. One can clearly distinguish the peak which
indicates the true number of petals for $\sigma_0$ up to
$10^{-2}$.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \subfigure[$p=5$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig4_a.eps}}
  \subfigure[$p=7$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig4_b.eps}}
  \caption{Mean values of the anti-diagonal entries of $\Dcrpo$ for the flowers of
    5 and 7 petals at different noise levels.}
  \label{fig:matching_flower}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Stability.}
Let us consider now the model \eqref{eq:flower} with a general
$\mathcal{C}^1$ function $h(\xi)$ in place of $\cos(p\xi)$. It was
proven in \cite{AGKLY11} that:
\begin{align}
  N_{mn}^{(1)}(B_p) = 2\pi\eta\frac{mn}{\lambda^2}\hat
  h_{m+n} + O(\eta^2).
  \label{eq:flower_CGPT_Fourier}
\end{align}
Therefore as long as the perturbation $h(\xi)$ is close to
$\cos(p\xi)$, the significant nonzero coefficients in $\Dcrpo(D)$
will concentrate on the same anti-diagonals. We confirm this
observation by applying the same procedure above on a flower with
one damaged petal:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:damaged_flower}
  \partial B_p(\xi) =
  \begin{cases}
    x(\xi)f(\xi, t) \ &\mbox{ for } \xi\in[0,2\pi/p),\\
    \nm
    x(\xi)(1+\eta \cos(p\xi)) \ &\mbox{ for } \xi\in[2\pi/p,
    2\pi).
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
Here, $f(\cdot, t):\R\mapsto\R$ is a polynomial of order 6,
constructed such that $\partial B_p$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth,
and $t \in (0,1)$ is the percentage of the damage; see
Figure~\ref{fig:imperfect_flower}. In
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_imperfect_flower} we plot the mean value
of the anti-diagonal entries at different noise levels. Compared
to Figure~\ref{fig:matching_flower}, we see that the effect of the
damage in the petal dominates the measurement noise. Nonetheless,
the peak indicating the true number of petals is still visible.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \subfigure[$t=0.5$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig5_a.eps}}
  \subfigure[$t=0.8$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig5_b.eps}}
  \caption{Flowers with one damaged petal. The following parameters
    are used in \eqref{eq:damaged_flower}: $p=7$, $\eta=0.3$,
    $t=0.5$ for (a) and $t=0.8$ for (b).}
  \label{fig:imperfect_flower}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htp]

  \subfigure[$t=0.5$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig6_a.eps}}

    Figure~\ref{fig:imperfect_flower} at different noise levels. The peaks indicate the number of petals.}
  \label{fig:matching_imperfect_flower}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dictionary of letters}
Next we consider here a dictionary consisting of 26 Roman capital
letters without rotational symmetry. The shapes are defined in
such a way that the holes inside the letters are filled, see
Figure~\ref{fig:all_letters_A_Z}. We set $\delta/R=0.5$, $s= 2.47,
\theta = 6.08, z= [33.35, 73.84]$ and the center of mass of the
target at $[33.40, 73.86]$.

\paragraph{Performance of Algorithm 1.}
% \begin{figure}[htp]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{figures/fig5_p_acq.eps}
%   \caption{Data acquisition configuration for the letter ``P''. We use
%   $N=101$ sources/receivers with $\delta/R=0.5$, and the measurement
%   circle is centered at $z_0=[74, 76.8]$.}
%   \label{fig:acq_letter_p}
% \end{figure}

First we test Algorithm \ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} on the letter
``P''. For the noiseless case ($\sigma_0=0$), the values of $e_n$
defined in Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} are plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_letter_p} (a) and (b). These results
suggest that the high order CGPTs can better distinguish similar
shapes such as ``P'' and ``R'', since they contain more high
frequency information \cite{AGKLY11}. Nonetheless, the advantage
of using high order CGPTs drops quickly when the data are
contaminated by noise, and low order CGPTs provide more stable
results in this situation, see Figure~\ref{fig:matching_letter_p}
(c) and (d).

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0$, order $\leq 2$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig7_a.eps}}
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0$, order $\leq 5$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig7_b.eps}}
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0.1$, order $\leq 2$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig7_c.eps}}
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0.1$, order $\leq 5$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig7_d.eps}}
  \caption{The identification of the letter ``P'' using the first 2,
    and 5 orders CGPTs at noise levels $\sigma_0=0$ and
    $\sigma_0=0.1$. The bar represents the relative error $e_n$
    between the CGPTs of the $n$-th letter and that of the data, as
    defined in Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt}, and the shortest
    one in each figure corresponds to the identified letter. For (c)
    and (d), the experiment has been repeated for 100 times, using
    independent draws of white noise, and the results are the mean
    values of all experiments.}
  \label{fig:matching_letter_p}
\end{figure}

By repeating the same procedure as above, we apply
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} on all letters at noise
levels $\sigma_0=0$ and $\sigma_0=0.1$, and show the result in
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_all_letters} (a) and (c). At the
coordinate $(m,n)$, the unknown shape is the $m$-th letter and the
color represents the relative error (in logarithmic scale) of the
CGPTs when compared with the $n$-th standard letter of the
dictionary.

% As long as only the low
% order CGPTs are considered, the diagonal remains visible even in
% highly noisy case, e.g., $\sigma_0=0.5$.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0$, order $\leq 5$, Standard letters]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig8_a.eps}}
  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0$, order $\leq 5$, Perturbed letters]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig8_c.eps}}

  \subfigure[$\sigma_0=0.1$, order $= 1$, Perturbed letters]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{dico/figures/fig8_d.eps}}
  \caption{Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} applied on the all 26
    letters using the standard dictionary
    (Figure~\ref{fig:all_letters_A_Z}) at noise level $\sigma_0=0$
    (first column) and $\sigma_0=0.1$ (second column), with the color
    indicating the relative error $e_n$ in logarithmic scale. The
    unknown shapes in the first row are exact copies of the standard
    dictionary, and in the second row are those of
    Figure~\ref{fig:all_ptb_letters_A_Z}. In (a) all letters are
    correctly identified, while in (b) letters 'E' is identified as
    'H'. For the noisy case, the experiment has been repeated 100
    times, using independent draws of white noise, and the results in
    (c) and (d) are the mean values of all experiments, where only the
    first order CGPT is taken into account. 22 and 21 letters
    are correctly identified in (c) and (d), respectively.}
  \label{fig:matching_all_letters}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Stability.}
In real world applications we would like to have
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} work also on shapes which
are not exact copies of the dictionary, such as handwriting
letters (in the case of the present dictionary). In the case of
electrolocation, this is motivated by the fact that the targets for the
fish do not share exactly the same shape.
Figure~\ref{fig:all_ptb_letters_A_Z} shows the letters
obtained by perturbing and smoothing the dictionary elements. With
these letters as unknown shapes, we repeat the experiment of
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_all_letters} (a) and (c) by applying
Algorithm \ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} on the standard dictionary
and show the results in Figure~\ref{fig:matching_all_letters} (b)
and (d). Comparing with the results of
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_all_letters} (a) and (c), we see that
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} remains quite stable,
despite of some slight degradations.

\paragraph{Performance of Algorithm 2.}
In the case of noiseless data,
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv} provides correct results with
low computational cost. Here we repeat the experiment in
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_letter_p} (a) and (c) using
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv}, and plot the error $e_n$
defined in Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv} in
Figure~\ref{fig:matching_all_letters_inv}. Nonetheless, when data
are noisy, Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} performs
significantly better than Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv}, as
shown by Figure~\ref{fig:algorithm_cgpt_vs_inv} where we compare
the two algorithms for identifying letter ``P'' at various noise
levels. Thanks to the debiasing step \eqref{eq:tsr_lst_debiasing},
Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-cgpt} is much more robust with
respect to noise than Algorithm~\ref{algo:shape-ident-inv}, in
which there is no debiasing and the invariance of the shape
descriptors $\Dcrpo$ and $\Dcrpt$ may be severely affected by
noise (see Figure \ref{fig:algorithm_cgpt_vs_inv}).

\paragraph{Performance of Algorithm 2 with partial aperture}

We also studied the influence of a limited angle of view on the
matching of dictionary, with the two following configurations.
In the first
configuration, $N=51$ sources/receivers are equally distributed
between $[0,\pi)$, see Figure~\ref{fig:setp_aov1}.
In the second configuration, we
divide the sources/receivers into $5$ groups placed in a nonuniform
way on $[0, 2\pi)$, and each group covers only an angle range of
$0.2\pi$, see Figure~\ref{fig:setp_aov2}.
As we can see in Figures~\ref{fig:results_aov1} and~\ref{fig:results_aov1},
it is not possible to recover the shape, even without noise. Thus, we will
not study the effect of noise. Let us remark that this will be a obstacle in
applying these algorithm for electrolocation. We will see in
chapter~\ref{chap:pnas} that we can avoid this problem using multi-frequency
measurements.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this chapter, we have designed two fast algorithms which identify
a target using a dictionary of precomputed GPTs data.
The first algorithm matches the computed GPTs (as specified in chapter~\ref{chap:GPT-extraction}) to
precomputed ones (the dictionary elements) by finding rotation,
scaling, and translation parameters and therefore, identifies the
true target shape. The second algorithm  is based on new
invariants for the CGPTs. We have provided new shape descriptors
which are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling. The
stability (in the presence of additive noise in multistatic
measurements) and the resolution issues for both algorithms have
been numerically investigated. The second algorithm is
computationally much cheaper than the first one. However, it is
more sensitive to measurement noise in the imaging data. To the
best of our knowledge, our procedure is the first approach for
real-time target identification in imaging using dictionary
matching. It shows that GPT-based representations are an
appropriate and natural tool for imaging. Our approach can be
extended to electromagnetic and elastic imaging as well
\cite{mc2,resol}. In~\cite{wang2013-3DSD}, shape desciptors in $\R^3$ were derived,
allowing us to extend our approach to $3D$ problems.


%We have also successfully applied our original approach for
%recognizing a shape, obtained from one element of a dictionary of
%standard shapes after some rotation, scaling and translation. We
%have tested the robustness of our procedure with respect to noise
%and shown its viability. A comprehensive comparison between our
%approach and moment-based shape representations has been given. It
%shows that CGPT-based shape representations may be superior to
%moment-based ones.
